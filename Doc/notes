Notes 

----------02 June 2001----------

Using the gaussian_taketa.py program now. What works:

he_2s:
Everything works, although GAMESS's values for (22|11) match mine for
(21|21) and vice versa. Their integrals may use physics notation
rather than chemists. Not sure, though. Never noticed this before.

h2_2s:
S,t work.
V doesn't

he_sp:
S,t,v for 1s and 2p on the same center
(1s,1s|1s,1s) on the same center

h_sp:
S,t
Nuclear doesn't work when shifting center.


----------03 June 2001----------
Fixed a bug in _Fgamma: the minimum value of x should be set with
abs(x) rather than x, since I believe values < 0 are valid.

Didn't fix the problems in v for h2_2s.

Make an easier test case: proton at 0,0,0, 1s gaussian at 1,0,0.
Call this h_off.

Fixed a bug in nuclear: p. 2317 of THO wasn't clear whether eps =
1/(4*gamma) or eps = gamma/4. I had assumed the later, but it turns
out that it's the former.

h_off now matches.

h2_2s s,t,v now match.

The twoe integrals don't match, though. The ones where all four are on
the same center match, but ones with mixed centers don't.

Reproduced this in coul_1s_test: two 1s gaussians 1 bohr apart.
Found one mistake: gaussian computes the 2e integral as <ij|ij>,
 gaussian_taketa computes [ii|jj]. Fixed this -- which also explains
 the confusion I had yesterday regarding the 2e integrals. But there
 is still a problem somewhere.

Oddly enough, fixed a mistake in gaussians. Typo:
(alphaa+alphab+alphac+alphad) was in fact
(alphaa+alphab+alphad+alphad). Still didn't affect the  outcome.

Fixed another bug:
delta = 0.25*(1/gamma1+1/gamma2) (it was 0.25(gamma1+gamma2)).

h2_2s now matches for the two e integrals as well.

It seems like either the B terms are incorrect, or the F terms are
incorrect.

In all of the cases that the integrals work, all of the B terms are
either 0 or 1, and the F term is 1.

Other observations: only the gser subfunction is tested. gcf never
gets called. All of the arguments appear to be very small.

For want of a better idea, I'm going to start looking at the B's,
since the Fgamma code is also tested with the one-e int code a little
bit (although by no means completely). Also, I copied the Fgamma code
from numerical recipes (again, though, by no means correctly). Might
be worthwhile to compare against the compiled fortran code at some
point.

Testing the B's...

----------11 June 2001----------

Did some more testing of F_gamma. Programmed Shavitt's expression for
small t (p.8 of the paper, eq 24). This matches my results for
multiple m's for everything I've tested.

Clearly this isn't the mistake.

----------13 June 2001----------
Rewrote the coulomb routine to have a maximum 5th order loop instead
of the 15th order I had before.

Get the same (incorrect) results, but much easier to read.

It works! Turned out that when I simplified the code sufficiently and
reused as many small routines as possible I realized that I had
dropped the _fact(u) from the denominator.

Testing h2_sp

One_E ints work!
TwoE ints that don't work in GAMESS notation:
             I get	  GAMESS gets
5 2 1 1	     0.729788	  0.533009
5 1 2 1      ???          0.983 (mine should be the same?)
5 3 1 3      .983	  .983 (5 3 3 1)

But other integrals that might not match 
e.g. 5 5 2 2 do match.

Could GAMESS be averaging the exchanges?

5 1 1 1 = 0.631398	matches
5 2 1 1 = 0.729788	0.533008578071E+00
5 2 1 2 = -0.028665	???
5 3 1 3 = 0.098390	5 3 3 1 matches
5 4 1 4 = 0.098390	5 4 4 1 matches
5 5 1 1 = 0.842701	
5 1 2 1 = -0.098390	wrong sign
5 2 2 1 = -0.028665	???
5 2 2 2 = 0.584140	0.539206246552E+00
5 3 2 3 = -0.028665
5 4 2 4 = -0.028665
5 5 2 1 = -0.213797
5 5 2 2 = 0.848944
5 3 3 1 = 0.098390
5 3 3 2 = -0.028665
5 5 3 3 = 0.735802
5 4 4 1 = 0.098390
5 4 4 2 = -0.028665
5 5 4 4 = 0.735802
5 1 5 1 = 0.415107
5 2 5 1 = 0.415107
5 2 5 2 = 0.484292
5 3 5 3 = 0.069185
5 4 5 4 = 0.069185
5 5 5 1 = 0.631398
5 5 5 2 = 0.533009
5 5 5 5 = 1.128379
6 1 1 1 = -0.533009	-0.729787961457E+00
6 2 1 2 = 0.075923	wrong sign

So there are several discrepancies: wrong signs. Possible averaged
exchanges.


----------14 June 2001----------
Rewrote the nuclear and kinetic routines to be shorter and easier to
understand. I also reuse more code, to make maintenance easier and
bugs less likely.

Wrote a contracted (CGBF) and primitive (renamed gaussian_taketa to
PGBF) package. Am now writing test programs to test this out.

he_631.py tests 1s contracted functions. All 1e and 2e ints work.

h2_631s.py tests 1s, 2s and 2p contracted functions, on two different
centers. Most 1e integrals work, although there is something wrong
with:
<1s,1|t+v|2px,2>
<2px,1|t+v|1s,2>
<2px,1|t+v|2s,2>
since the corresonding T terms are correct, the problem is with the
nuclear attraction.

The 2e ints with all terms on 1 center are correct. Many of the ones
on mixed centers are wrong, starting with (63|11). This may be related
to the 1e problems I'm having.

To debug this problem, go back to h2_sp.py

1e ints match, as do the 2e ints on the same center. But 2e ints on
different center do not match.

----------19 June 2001----------
Fixed a bug in the 1e V ints:

        #Ax = _A_array(l1,l2,P[0]-A[0],P[0]-B[0],C[0]-P[0],gamma)
should have been:
        Ax = _A_array(l1,l2,P[0]-A[0],P[0]-B[0],P[0]-C[0],gamma)
(etc. for Ay and Az)

All of the 1e ints in h2_631s.py now work.

The first 2e ints to not work in h2_631s are 63-11 and 61-31.
Changing from abs(p-a) to p-a in _fB has no effect.

Changed:
          *pow(Px-Qx,i1+i2-2*(r1+r2)-2*u) \
to:
          *pow(Qx-Px,i1+i2-2*(r1+r2)-2*u) \
in _B_term, and now several more terms work.

In fact, now only one term doesn't work: (63|31) works, but (64|41)
doesn't. My program gets these two terms to be equal to each other,
but GAMESS has them different. Could be that GAMESS changes its
reference frame.

Here's the part that differs:
  (63|31)     0.1712  0.1713  
**(64|41)     0.1065  0.1713**
**(65|51)     0.1065  0.1713**
  (61|33)     0.5974  0.5975  
**(61|44)     0.5691  0.5975**
**(61|55)     0.5691  0.5975**
  (63|32)     0.1121  0.1121  
**(64|42)     0.0682  0.1121**
**(65|52)     0.6820  0.1121**
  (62|33)     0.4364  0.4364  
**(62|44)     0.4127  0.4364**
**(62|55)     0.4127  0.4364**
  (63|33)     0.4973  0.4973  
**(63|44)     0.4241  0.4973**
**(63|55)     0.4241  0.4973**

Go back to h2_sp to see how it looks: Quite a few are wrong.

Removed the abs() from _fB, and everything matches.

Went back to check h2_631s. Still wrong in the same places. Odd that
nothing changed.

Found the problem: I had actually entered the px functions three times
instead of entering separate functions for the x, y, and z
bases. Everything works now.


----------20 June 2001----------
   Tested h2o/6-31G**, which reproduces the GAMESS energy. The
   integrals are very slow, however.

Just tried running h2o, and there is still a problem with the new
routines. I.e.,

H2O: -74.764101
Energy =  1563.19315451
Energy =  139.402946893
Energy =  1396.67898276

Putting in the pyutil version of ijk2intindex. Still didn't work, so
going back to cutil version of ijk2intindex, and will use the pyutil
version of fB

H2: -1.083260
H2O: -74.764101
Energy =  1563.19315451
Energy =  139.402946893
Energy =  1396.67898276

Still doesn't work.

----------23 June 2001----------

Now use pyutil version of ijk2..., fB, and fact_ratio2. Still didn't
work. 

Now go back to pyutil versions of everything.
H2O: -74.764101
Energy =  1563.19315451
Energy =  139.402946893
Energy =  1396.67898276

Now go back to pyutil versions of everything. Still doesn't work. Damn
damn damn.

Test h2: still works with everything in pyutil. Also works with
everything in cutil.

Interestingly, the cutil and pyutil versions give exactly the same
wrong answer.

I have replaced gammln with the C library function lgamma. This
shouldn't improve anything, but should be faster, and should be less
code to maintain. There is also a "tgamma" function in the -lm
library, but I don't know what that does.
 
Still gives the same wrong answer.

Okay, go back to the python versions of everything, and see what I've

See if I can find a simpler case: LiH?

LiH also doesn't work:
LiH: -7.900068
Energy =  21.4723372454
Energy =  85.3812870746

For LiH, the overlap matrix matches.
The one-electron integrals do not match, for the <s|t+v|xx> terms!

Okay, here's the line that seems to be causing the problem:
if val < SMALL: return 0
in Fgamma.

I had put this line in to get the C and Py versions of Fgamma to
agree.

LiH now works!
LiH: -7.900068
Energy =  -7.55238503575
Energy =  -7.89744258211
Energy =  -7.89987188533
Energy =  -7.90003411775
Energy =  -7.90006044044

Put in the C routines, but comment out the val<SMALL part.

Works: exactly the same results. Here's the profiling:

Guess I need to move coulomb etc into pyutils. Actually, what I need
to do is move all of the work functions in PGBF into pyutils.

Moved overlap_kernel into pyutil. Still works.
Moved nuclear_repulsion into pyutil. Still works.
Moved coulomb_repulsion into pyutil. Still works. 1263.24 sec.

Moved coulomb_repulsion into cutil. Doesn't work, but only takes 100
sec.

Getting closer, although some of the 2eints still don't work:
Should be:
(19,19|18,12)=0.249542
(19,19|18,18)=0.848142
(19,19|19,4)=0.118960
(19,19|19,8)=0.049367
(19,19|19,14)=0.282706
(19,19|19,19)=0.966487

yutil. Still works.

Sigh. The coulomb stuff still takes a long time.

Putting the rest of the functions in C, since they're effectively
done. Overlap_kernel is there, and the time has increased slightly, to
179 sec.

Putting in nuclear_attraction, and the time is 170 sec.

Made it a tiny bit faster by removing some redundant calls from the
top of coulomb. 156 sec.

Why is the slow part in the PGBF coulomb rather than the cutil
coulomb?? Are function calls to get variables slower than direct
access? Try out direct access to see the difference. But this may make
a bigger difference in profiling than it does in the normal code.

Amazing! Took the time for PGBF::coulomb from 200 to 50! Does this
have the same impact on the non-profiling runtime? 146 sec.

I guess the moral is that if you do something 200,000 times, even
small things have an impact.


----------25 June 2001----------
Renamed *util* to *ints*, and confirmed that it works. I think
cints/pyints makes more sense given what the routines do. Am also
considering writing a C++ interface to the code, and may actually
convert everything to C++ (using it as a "better C").

Also broke off all of the wrapper functions to a file called
cints_wrap.c. This will make things a bit cleaner when I write a C++
wrapper. 

----------18 July 2001----------
Got the C version of the code working (subdirectory "c"). It's
surprisingly slow, which is reassuring in its own way. The pure C code
takes 75 seconds for lih (4 iterations, converged to -7.892 107, when
the true answer is -7.900 068).

In 4 iterations the python code had already gotten to -7.900 034, and
in five it had converged to -7.900 060, taking 107 sec. This indicates
that there is probably a small numerical mistake somewhere in the C
code. But the good news is that the python code isn't that slow
afterall, which indicates that I can use this code for my development
without worrying too much that I'm wasting time.

Interestingly, the integrals take about the same amount of time in
both (eyeball test). The noticable difference between the two is the
scf iterations. I had assumed that it was the integrals that were the
slow part, and that the SCF was fast in python. Might be worth
spending some time to figure out why this is the case.

Taking out debugging flags, and compiling -O3 yields 54 secs.

Run H2 to see if I can find the source of the numerical error. The
results are exactly the same.


Now trying to convert the C code to C++, to (1) simplify the code, and
(2) learn more about C++. The first step is to leave the data
structures the same, and update the code to C++.

A. Remove the struct's. Done.
B. Remove the linked-list data structures. This involves removing next
   pointers from the structs, and removing structs that consist
   entirely of pointers to heads and tails. Done, although there are
   now lots of compile errors.
C. Starting at the smallest level, make the structs into classes.
   Done; cbf and pbf tests work, but dmatrix and hartree_fock tests
   crash. 

Got the test cases to work; I now have a working HF code in C++.

ToDo List:
1. obj.print() with overloaded operator<< friend function
   DONE
2. Replace C-style casts with C++ casts.
3. Profile code.
4. Talk to Julian or Michael to see how to improve code.
5. Run the code through Parasoft tools to see if there are problems.
6. Figure out the source of the numerical errors.
7. Make private variables private

Also consider looking at which values of fact are called most, to
consider caching some more.

Can also accelerate binomial in much the same way.

According to this, I've slowed the code down, but I'm not sure I can
trust these results.

Put back in optimization and see what the timing is now. 50.3 sec. Seems
like a lot of work for 3 seconds speedup. Does caching 2 more values
help? time now = 49.3 sec. 

Any more than this and ints probably aren't useful anyway. This might
be a problem. See what values are called.

The largest values appears to be 3. Most of the values (by far) are
zero. I put in the line
  if (a+b+c == 0) return 1;
in both binomial and fact_ratio2 to see if this speeds the code
up. 48.9 seconds.

Look at profiling now:

It looks like this is all high-hanging fruit. Stop worrying about
this. If you want to speed something up, look at Rhys quadrature for
the coulomb repulsion.



----------20 July 2001----------
Things to improve: 
(1) numerical difference btw python and C/C++ codes.
(2) understand why python is taking more time during the SCF
iterations. Is it computing D in python?
(3) try out a recursion relationship for Fgamma


Working on Fgamma first. Look at what the typical arguments are:

Again, (0,0) are the most common calls. Fgamma(0,0) should be 1. See
if this speeds things up. 

I've simplified the Fgamma function a great deal:
double Fgamma(int m, double x){
  if (fabs(x) < SMALL) return 1./(2.*m+1.);
  return 0.5*pow(x,-m-0.5)*gamm_inc(m+0.5,x);
}

I've also made an array of calls from Fgamma.

Todays changes decreased the execution time to 34 sec.

Binomial prefactor and binomial take up most of the rest of the time.
Look at the arguments passed in. 
First rule:
  if (ia == 0 && ib == 0) return 1.;
down to 32 sec.
  if ( ((fabs(xpa)+fabs(xpb)) < SMALL) && s == 0) return 0.;
down to 30 sec.

Did similar tests with GAMESS, which only took 1 sec for LiH.


----------19 Sept 2001----------
Okay, wrote and debugged an implementation of Head-Gordon/Poples
horizontal and vertical recursion relationships. I've checked the
accuracy for a number of different integrals. Problem is that the code
is incredibly slow.

For an integral with 4 d_x2 orbitals, the cints technique takes 0.002
sec, and the hgp technique takes 2.17 sec.

I have not, of course, moved anything into C yet.

Profiling.

Okay, put vrr into cints.

Testing accuracy: works

Got the timing down from 2.17 sec to .12 sec, but it's still ~60 times
slower than the old way (which I already know is too slow).

Here's the profiling for a larger case (ff|ff):
   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
    127/1   13.700    0.108   13.700   13.700 hgp.py:15(hrr)

        4    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 PGBF.py:50(powers)

(this case took something like 273 seconds before, so it's a big
improvement).

using the C version of hrr gives:
   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1   13.500   13.500   13.500   13.500 <string>:1(?)

        1    0.000    0.000   13.500   13.500 profile:0(hrr(b.origin(),b.norm(),

means that it takes the same amount of time in C and Python.

--------20 Sept 2001--------------

The timing is slower for the Contracted hrr calls:
0.0262349843979 1.46051096916

I'm going to put everything in C++ and profile there.

Here are the results, profiling 1000 calls to <z2,z2|z2,z2> using both
hrr and the pbf.coulomb functions:

My reading of this is that the hrr algorithm (389 sec) takes
significantly longer than the coulomb_repulsion (.581 sec). 

Sigh. Maybe I have to cache the calls. But at this point it doesn't
look like I'm getting any kind of savings, and thus there doesn't seem
to be any point in looking at the hrr calls on contracted functions.

Wouldn't be a bad idea to look at the Gill/Head-Gordon/Pople
technique. Maybe they can explain how they cache things.

I should also finish up the rys code.

---------1 May 2002-------------------

Wow. Big layoff since I've worked on this. Got both rys and hgp code
working. C version of HGP also done. Studying timings for integrals
only:

                -------Python-----	 --------C---------
		Taketa	Rys	HGP	 Taketa	Rys	HGP
h2/6-31G**	18.8	12.0	22.8	 1.2		1.4
h2o/6-31G**	2155		10851	 89.6		324.9

Still can't do rys on h2o, since it needs higher order roots than I've
programmed thus far.

Profile the working C h2o cases:

It strikes me that I can construct a call to a C integral routine that
will do contracted integrals in C, to avoid the loops in python in
CGBF.coulomb(). I can do this for Taketa, Rys, and HGP integrals as
well.

Here's the profiling, calling contr_coulomb():

Doesn't look like it changed very much.

I wonder how all of this would change with optimization? I'm compiling
now without any.

h2o/6-31G**	2155		10851	 75.7	114.3		263.8	429.1

Don't understand why it's so much slower doing the iteration in
C. HGP2/Take2 both should have been much faster than HGP/Taketa.

h2o/6-31G**	2155		10851	 75.7	66.6		263.8	259.1

I'm beginning to think that the slowdowns with the "2" versions I saw
were simply due to fluctuations in the runtimes. I've gotten runtimes
ranging from 80 to 68. So that explains that mystery, but I still
don't understand why I don't get more of a speedup when I call HGP2,
for example.

Redoing the PySequence calls with PyList calls to see if it speeds
things up. It might, but causes a Seg Fault. Trying
PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM also SegFaults.


See if I can speed code up by only allocating one large space of
memory in the module and then reusing it.

                -------Python-----	 --------C---------
		Taketa	Rys	HGP	 Taketa	Take2	Rys	HGP	HGP2

h2o/6-31G**	2155		10851	 75.7	65.6		263.8	259.0

Not much difference in performance, but I guess that every bit helps.

From hereafter the "2" versions will be the default.

Brought the overall scf time from 230 to 72 by doing dot products.
Brought the overall scf timing down to 38 by only doing half of the

Got the code to work under Cygwin! Little bit slower, requiring 30/100

Working on grids for DFT.

Went through a long frustrating experiment with RectangularGrid. Using
very dense grids I was able to get the norm of the orbital down to 4.1
(it should have been 1.0).

But now I see that I'm making a mistake somewhere, because using my
radial grids, now, I'm getting exactly the same result?! Clearly I'm
getting a constant wrong somewhere.

What follows is the norm of <orb[0]|orb[0]>, computed on the grid:

Rectangular grids:
11^3: 127.97
21^3: 17.66
41^3: 4.86
81^3: 4.1014

Gauss-Legendre Radial, Lebedev angular:
default: 4.10045
high-ang: 4.10045

Looks like we're converging. But why the factor of 4.1??

Fixed a bug (needed to multiply by the CGBF normalization and by the
PGBF coefficient):

Grid:        S00	Nel
R(11^3)	     2.62	2.62
R(21^3)	     1.107	1.107
R(41^3)	     1.003	1.003
Sphere	     0.99999	1.0

Cool!

Comparing the result of this to molpro. Almost exactly the same, now.
Printing out rho,ex,vx gives nearly the same results. Still, there
are major discrepancies in the values that derive from these differ
significantly.
They're multiplying all of the vx's by a constant
 (fac=dftfac(idftfu))
...except when I check, the constant is 1. And I still can't figure out
how the energies are different, since my energy at each point is very
close to the MP value, and yet the total is very different.

2002-07-12
Comparing my results to DeFT to make sure I'm doing everything right.

First step: atomic grids for He.

I had to do several hacks to make this work.
1. Deft only uses 26 points per angular grid. I changed my code to do
   this.
2. Deft does a random spin of each angular grid, which I removed.
3. Deft prunes the grids based (?) on the character of the basis
   functions at each grid point.

Working around these differences, we are now making exactly the same
grid.

Hard to figure out what's going on in deft. Can't find a simple place
where they sum the xc energy. And since the programs are different,
it's hard to really compare what's going on. still, it seems that I'm
in the right ballpark for the xc energy and potential. Strange that I
would be so off the sums, though.

2002-07-13
What do I know. The grids and the weights are correct. I'm inputting
the orbitals from jaguar, so those are correct. And the densities that
I form at each grid point appears to be correct to within an order of
magnitude or so. I know that ex and vx are incorrect, despite the fact
that I've used every possible way to make them.

The Pople form seems to be the closest to the correct energy. But the
potential is really off.

Oooh. I just realized that if I use the Molpro version, and if I
remove the dens in the quadrature of the energy, that I get the right
value of the energy. But the integration of the potential is still
off. The potential integration seems to be better if I omit the dens,
and in a way it makes sense, because bf[a].amp(x,y,z)*bf[b].amp(x,y,z)
is kinda density like.

Using a fudge factor of 0.5 gets me much closer to the proper values,
0.25 is even better, 0.1 is even better.

Ah, it works. I had J in instead 2J. Now I don't need a fudge factor
in anyway.

indicate that vc is alright even though ec is not:

Some questions to answer:
1. How do I cut off the seitz radius?
2. There is an x term (and a xx(x) array) in the molpro dftfun.f
routine. What is this and how do I work with it?

Molpro VWN works. Looks like I match what Jaguar calls VWN5. But I
match it to many decimal places!

Priorities from here on out:

- Grids for many atom systems
- DFT for many atom systems
- Clean up dft modules!
- Simple speed improvements for DFT/LDA
----Release 1.0---
- Forces
- Divide and Conquer
----Release 1.1---
- LSD
  - HH hybrid functionals (since they use LDA only?)?
- ROHF
- GVB
----Release 1.2---
- GGA
- Hybrid functionals
----Release 1.3---
- CI/MCSCF
- MPn/CCSD
----Release 1.4---

Testing on Ne before I go on to many-atom molecules:

Pretty damn good! Getting an error message about Nel being off in
setdens.

Can we do some more efficient orbital updating scheme, where the
averaging parameter is optimized each iteration? We needed averaging
to converge Ne.

Fixed the setdens bug: it was really just a print bug, since the
program already correctly made sure that tot_ne = Z, but then printed
out tot_ne and Z/2. This has now been corrected. Have also decreased
the tolerance above which the program complains about the density
integration to 0.05 e. Seems silly to complain if we're only missing
0.0001 electron!

Retesting with full grid. For He it raises the number of points from
832 to 1792. I have made what used to be 'coarse' now called 'medium',
and have introduced a new 'coarse'. The new coarse is still more than
good enough for He.

Running different grids for Ne. Seems to work perfectly well with the
new coarse (556 points).

Working on a grid pruning scheme. The idea is to remove a gridpoint if
(w_i * dens_i) is less than 0.00001. This is a very small cutoff, so I
think it's a pretty safe bet. Pruning cuts the coarse grid sizes down
by 1/2 without changing the answer.

Made a new module called MolecularGrid. Put everything from
atomic_dft into dft. Confirmed that dft works for He and Ne atoms.

Here's the profiling for He using the atomic code:

No real surpises here. Also tested the dft.py routine to insure that
there aren't any additional sources of errors here. Seems to be the
same (no surprise, really). Will soon altogether remove atomic_dft.py
and use dft.py in place of it.

Am not worrying too much about speed now, but would like things to be
a bit quicker. Need to figure out how to make fewer calls to the
bf.amp() functions. I could build a collocation matrix like PSGVB did.

Also need to figure out a more elegant way of dealing with the basis
functions. Would be nice if we had one grid loop rather than looping
over the atomic grids and then each point in the grids.

Okay, finally tried water. It does not work. Starting from the
converged orbitals yields:

      Jaguar	    PyQuante
Nel   10	    8.26
Etot   -75.842 134   -82.349
Eone  -121.514 214  -111.514
Etwo    37.318 570    
 Ej     46.003 565    37.006
 Ek	-8.684 995    -7.841 

Trying to figure out what's wrong. Running H2 now. The energy doesn't
change much when I remove the points, but maybe that's because I've
already set the weights to zero.

Taking out the part of the code that sets the weights to zero if
they're closer to another atom:

Here's the convergence of the whole program:

Here's the convergence with the point deletion removed:

So it's doing something. 

Tried a variety of other things. I've tried removing the points in
different ways, to make sure that the right points are removed. I've
also tried running with denser grids. All give essentially the same
results.

Getting pretty close. Probably still a few bugs, but looking good. Try
without Jaguar input guess.


Things to try:
1. Rotating the grids as DeFT does
2. Becke projection

Consider computing a collocation matrix: the amplitude of the basis
functions at each grid point. All of the bf.amp() calls that I do
during the XC computation.

I can do this in a number of different ways. I can compute a huge
collocation matrix, or I can store the info on each grid point.
The latter might be the most natural.

Ended up implementing the collocation matrix, because the code is too
slow for molecules. I distributed the collocation elements. The
downside to this is that it increases the memory, perhaps
unnecessarily, but I can worry about memomory later.

---------------------------2002-07-21---------------------------------------
Looking at the water energy. Having a hard time converging the result,
even with averaging = 0.5. Plus I'm not integrating the density
accurately, even when I use the medium grids for everything.

I should derive decent grid parameters for each atom. Something like

h_grid = (Rmax,[24,24,26,26,32,32,24,24,24,24])

or maybe (Rmax,AngGridListCoarse,AngGridListMed,AngGridListFine)

Should also code up Becke projections, which will make a difference
when we start to move atoms around and want smooth scaling.

My results for water (1.0,90)
Term	   PyQuante	   Jaguar
Etot	   -75.6750432671  -75.850044
Eone	   -122.7649602	   -122.403 039
EJ	   46.8619817374   46.445 8
Ek	   -8.61313157115  -8.733 785
Enuke	   8.84106676647   8.841020

Should also test whether I'm pruning too many points.

But there may be some problems with water. I don't get the same result
as Jaguar when I start from the converged wfn:

-73.8921087218 -111.786676747 36.896660271 -7.84315901198 8.84106676647
-75.8650732967 -122.456252222 46.5061055792 -8.75599341997 8.84106676647

which makes me think that my grid isn't good enough. I noticed that
when I start with Jaguar's result, not as many points are pruned from
the H potential, which suggests that I may be a bit too aggressive
there.

Looks like I eventuallly get the right results, though.

I'll change the code to not do the main prune, and to only prune the
points that have their weight set to zero by the patching code.

Here are the noprune results:
First iter:
-73.8761511325 -111.786676747 36.896660271 -7.8272014227 8.84106676647
Last:
-75.854837765 -122.410716443 46.4546582514 -8.73984634016 8.84106676647

I'm still getting the wrong number of electrons on some of these
iterations. Should I renormalize via the weights?

The timing for the above water case is: 1286.870u 10.550s 26:43.23 
...this version is saved in getXC_old

Using a dot product for the XC matrix: 612.910u 6.640s 13:05.76 78.8%
...but the final energy was a little bit different (-75.844). This
version is saved in getXC_2

Writing a few functions now like w(), v(), e(), and dab() so that I
can do the exercises in getXC in a more matlab-like vector manner.

Interesting that as the wave function converges the tot_nel goes to
10. Maybe that's because the minimum energy is the one that has the
proper densities on the gridpoints.

Timing with vector code: 616.940u 9.240s 13:53.84 75.0%
Close enough that I'll keep it.

Maybe I can think of a better way to do the randomization of each grid
shell. Just staggering each grid by a specified amount, so that there
isn't a variation between grids. Another reason to rethink the way
that I'm putting grids together.

Putting in better timers.
The .bfprod routine took ~49-55 sec/iteration
The older way when I iterated over the grid took 43.8 sec per
iteration

Decreased down to 39.6 sec per iteration with a grid.bf(i) vector
function

A tiny bit faster, 39.1 sec per iter, doing the math a little
different.

Putting the nel renormalization back in takes a little bit of time
(1/2 sec per iteration), but is worth it because it provides less
variation between different grid orientations.

Got the per iter timing down below 30 (29.6!) by rewriting
GripPoint.setdens() to use dot products. May even be able to speed
this up more by using matrix multiplies. Don't have any great ideas
with regard to AtomicGrid.bfs() yet.

For some reason the code slowed down a great deal when I put in NumPy
arrays for the basis functions. Don't know why. Maybe the accessor
function is too slow.

Turns out it was the accessor function, not the NumPy array. The
matrix multiply brings the per iteration time to 12.5 sec! For a full
simulation the time went up to 16.8 sec/iter, with a total time of 300
sec.

Cool. Now turn the calls to S and VWN into vector calls. Turns out
that this is harder than I thought. S is trivial, but VWN is a complex
enough function that it's taking some time.

Down to 2.7 sec/iter, though.

I may have introduced an error, though. The energies I'm getting
aren't as low as they should be. -75.8311 rather than -75.853. Could I
have introduced an error? It could just be the random variation in the
grids. I should take out the random part, so that I'm at least getting
the same results every time, and can tell when I do something that
breaks the code.

Seems to be better now that I moved back to an older version of the
code. Taking 4.8 sec/iter, now, and I don't know what has caused the
increase. Looks like it's the additional call to VWN1.

Removing the random spin feature for the anggrids: final energy was
-75.8439 and the time per iter was 6.4, then 4.75, then 4.23?

Got the time back to 2.6.

Working on staggering rather than randomizing.

deg/shell:     Energy
0	       -75.8439
2.5	       -75.8129
5	       -75.8495
10	       -75.8347
45	       -75.8368
90	       -75.8439 (not surprising, null operation)
90*	       -75.8439
5*	       -75.8571
5.1*	       -75.8359 (bizzare, very ill-conditioned)

* mod(i,4) determines whether not to rotate (0), rotate x by 90 (1),
  rotate y by 90 (2), or rotate z by 90 (3)

So I'm going with 5*. But I shouldn't kid myself about the grids being
converged at this point.

Released PyQuante-1.0, and set up a PyQuante-users mailing list.


Attempted to do a simple DIIS routine. Ignored the stuff about
canonical orbitals, and just averaged DF-FD for AOs. Well, it isn't
working. Reasons? (1) Ignoring COs, (2) Outside of the radius of
convergence. I played around a bit trying to get into the radius of
convergence, but never made it. Looks like I have to read Pulay's
paper a bit more carefully and try again with COs.


2002-07-26

I'm still having problems with DIIS. I'm currently running He by just
computing the error vector and returning. The max value of the error
vector only gets as low as 19, even when the matrix is converged.

For some reason, He appears to work properly -- the error matrix
starts at 0.5 and goes down to 0.04 over ~10 iterations. However, the
convergence doesn't work.

I tried using the whole error matrix rather than the lower
triangle. No improvement. I also checked out the code for the
similarity transformation and traceproperty and it looks alright.
No idea.

Spent some time rereading Pualy's papers on DIIS. He derives
everything starting from a Davidson-type way of approximating the
Hessian. If that is right, though, it doesn't explain why the energy
ever goes up.

Also spent some time on DDJohnson's convergence routines, none of
which I managed to get working.

Finally, I spent some time figuring out the fastest way to do the
traceproperty calculation TP(A,B) = sum_ij A_ij*B_ij. There are 3 ways
to do this. Here are the results averaged over 10 runs with random
1000x1000 matrices:

sum(diagonal(matrixmultiply(A,B)))          178
sum(sum(A*B))                               0.65
dot(reshape(A,(n*m,)),reshape(B,(n*m,)))    0.057

It appears that the results aren't exactly the same, though, so I'm
sticking with the first one even though it's much slower.

2002-07-27
Still don't understand why the methods give different results. I
thought they were supposed to be the same. Still, I've found a method
that is almost as fast as the pure dot and gives the same results as
the trace-mm:

For 10 runs of size n = 200 
  trace-mm 100050.080  1.777 
   sum-sum 100205.585  0.178 
       dot 100205.585  0.022 
      loop 100205.585  4.021 
fast-trace 100050.080  0.082 

For 10 runs of size n = 500 
  trace-mm 624492.830 138.046 
   sum-sum 624389.675  1.139 
       dot 624389.675  0.186 
      loop 624389.675 31.340 
fast-trace 624492.830  0.591 

2002-07-29
Have had no luck getting convergence acceleration to work. Perhaps
rather than using sqrt<n-m|n-m> to determine the difference between
two density matrices, we should think about <n-m|S|n-m> or
sqrt<n-m|S|n-m>?

Using the fact that both n&m should be idempotent and thus <n|S|n> =
<m|S|m> = 1, D = sqrt(2-2<n|S|m>).

Todo:
* Becke projection operators
* Redo the way grids are parameterized and fit parameterization for
  all atoms
* Two-point DIIS, or 2 point D matrix averaging, or maybe full DIIS.
* Can we speed up TraceEnergy by using a dot-product of the 1-d reps
  of the matrices?


2002-08-21

I'm ready for an official release. Sent a prerelease notice to
different people to get enough feedback to make a version 1.0.1 before
I release it everywhere.

Randy Hall suggested that I put a kinetic function in pyints/cints, to
make the computation of this a little easier to understand. The way
that I do this now, where PGBF makes subsequent calls to
overlap_kernel, is confusing. Having separate overlap and kinetic
functions would be preferable.

Jeremy Kua suggested semiempirical techniques.

Konrad Hinsen suggested making this a package.

2002-09-03
Made some of the changes that Konrad suggested. The code is now a
proper package. Working on the other suggestions.

Wrote the pure python code to compute the kinetic energy. Testing on
h2o. 

Old code:
nbf =  25
int time =  21.9047989845
Final energy = -76.005909
scf time =  13.8176730871


New python code:
nbf =  25
int time =  23.9974490404
Final energy = -76.005909
scf time =  15.2314189672

Works! Also note the difference in CPU time, since the old code uses
the C-based overlap_kernel.

New C code:
In cints_wrap
int time =  21.9297950268
Final energy = -76.005909
scf time =  13.8325129747

Cool.

Since now I'm only using the overlap_kernel routines to do real
overlaps, I've now renamed them 'overlap', which makes more sense.

Checked in code, and rebuilt the source installation.

Charlie Schur noted that CGBF:coulomb has
    return a.norm()*a.norm()*a.norm()*a.norm()*Jij
when it should have
    return a.norm()*b.norm()*c.norm()*d.norm()*Jij

How did I miss this? 

I wrote a test suite to keep things like this from hapenning again. It
looks like everything is alright, although it seems that correcting
the bug didn't change anything (which I don't understand).

The test suite is called "TessSuite" and is in the tests directory.

Schur also asked for more documentation of the techniques for the XC
functionals and the DFT grid in the modules.

Think I've fixed Moritz Braun's problem. Turns out it was based on a
glibc problem that occurred when python went from libc to glibc.

On py1.5.2, 1.e-310**2 works, on py2.2 it underflows.

I put in the command
>>> where(dens < 1.e-10,0,dens)
to cut off small values of the density.

Also put in a comment about the provenence of the VWN functional

Also brushed up the test suite a bit:
Times:
 OS X: 722.6 sec
 Linux/Dell12: 265.4 sec

Removing the NO/FD from the test suite, since I think it is unstable.

Downloaded v1.0.3 and installed/tested it on linux -- it works.


2002-09-26
Test suite on OS X
Using CINTS: 443.66 sec

Reports from Patrick Nichols at University of New Orleans suggest that
the RYS code has a bug with larger basis sets.

Compiled/installed new rys code from PNichols. Can't test, because of
a problem with importing multiple symbols. This is related to a
problem that Konrad suggested a while back:

>There is one remaining portability problem: the C modules. They work
>fine on Linux, plus a few other platforms, but not everywhere. The
>problem is that all three C modules link the file util.c, so the
>exported symbols of that file will be present in memory three times if
>all modules are imported. On some platforms, that is not allowed.
>
>In fact, for optimal portability, all C symbols except for the module
>initialization functions should be "static". It's not always possible,
>but in any case the number of externally visible C symbols should be
>as small as possible.

Removed the link dependence of the util.c routines and rebuilding to
see what goes wrong:

cints needs: binomial_prefactor, fact_ratio2, dist2,
product_center_1D, Fgamma, fact2, fact

chgp needs: product_center_1D, dist2, Fgamma

crys needs: product_center_1D, dist2, binomial

satisfied crys,chgp,cints

Testing again. Didn't work. Looks like I have to move this around and
make a single module.

I tried two easy things: (1) simply defining everything in util
static. I don't think I did this right, because I got some comments
like "module xxx declared static but never defined" or some such.
(2) tried putting the individual routines into the different modules,
but this didn't work either.


Backed out all of my changes, and rerunning the diagnostics to make
sure that everything worked.

2002-09-27
Looks like if I define mods as static I have to put all of the
functions in the same file. Poked around the modules in the Python
distribution and it appears that these are all made that way. Each
function in that file should be static.

Playing around with the python -O option. The test suite now takes 466.
Guess it didn't change anything.

2002-09-28
Fixed the bug with the statically defined functions. Decided to define
each of the C modules as a single file, so combined all of the
appropriate functions appropriately.

Ran the test suite using the crys module:
with crys runs in 379 sec.

Confirmed that the new crys module works.

Set to release these files as PyQuante-1.0.4.

2002-09-29
Released files. Tested on Linux, found a bug in the c files, a
reference to util.h. Fixed and confirmed the tests work. Files
officially released now.

Celebrating a release by doing some work. Working on convergence
acceleration.
Simple averaging results: (Converging h2o(1\AA,90deg) to 10^-5)
Alpha  #it
1      18
0.75   11
0.5    15
0.25   20 (oscillated?!)

Anderson averaging 
Alpha  #it
1.0    26 slow, but well-behaved, a few values below 0
0.75   dnc
0.5    dnc (oscillated, values below 0)
0.25   dnc ditto

Put cutoffs of [0.1,1.0] on beta to see if this works better. Also
took out the alpha parameter, since I didn't find it doing anything.
Took 16 iterations.

Changed cutoffs to [0.01,1.5], which made the results oscillate before
converging in 14 iterations.

I'm uncomfortable with the Anderson averager because (1) the fact that
values < 0 are cropping up seems wrong, and (2) it doesn't appear
particularly stable, and (3) I don't see any advantage over simple
averaging.

Working on DIIS. Something strange is happening when I compute the
error matrix values: When the wfn is converged, the max err is still
20.3! Must be doing something wrong.

2002-10-03
Still trying to figure out what's wrong with the max err calculation. 
Ran the following tests from within Convergence.py:test_conv.py
    X = SymOrth(S)
    A = SimilarityTransform(S,X)
    mtx2file(A,'XtSX.dat')
This gives the Identity matrix I
    A = matrixmultiply(transpose(X),X)
    mtx2file(A,'XtX.dat')
Neither Diagonal nor I.
    A = matrixmultiply(X,transpose(X))
    mtx2file(A,'XXt.dat')
Diagonal but not I

This is very wrong!

Ran some simple tests: 
val,vec = Heigenvectors(S)
b = matrixmultiply(vec,transpose(vec))
c = matrixmultiply(transpose(vec),vec)

both b and c are identity (as they should be).

Must be doing something wrong in SymOrth that's breaking the
Unitariness of X.

Starting to think about using LinearAlgebra:cholesky_decomposition for
the generalized eigenvalue problem.

If our problem is 
  Fc = ScE
and we can decompose
  S = LLt
then
  C = L^-1F(L^-1)t
  L-1S = L-1LLtcE = LtcE
and thus
  C(Ltc) = E(Ltc)
where the eigenvalues are the same as for F, and the eigenvectors are
Ltc.

2002-10-04
Found a confusion in LA2.SymOrth: I was confusing the canonical
transformation method of orthogonalizing the orbitals with the
symmetric orthogonalization method of orthogonalizing the
orbitals. Both now work. I'm implementing the SymOrth one

I was also confused about XXt = XtX = I. This is not generally the
case with either the symmetric or the canonical orthogonalizations.

I'm bothered by the definitions of SimilarityTransform (XHXt) and
SimilarityTransformT (XtHX), which seem to be the opposite of what
they should be. However, this may just be a result of the stupid way
that Numpy defines matrices.

However, this does suggest why DIIS wasn't working: I had assumed that 
X(FDS-SDF)Xt = F'D'-D'F', but this isn't the case. Doesn't explain why
GVB-DIIS worked, though.

With this correction, DIIS is working much better now. But it always
gives energies that are too low (i.e. lower than the correct answer)
during the convergence. Something is definitely wrong.

Here's the convergence, along with the coefficient vector c:

This may simply be an artifact of the small radius of convergence of
the DIIS method, although I can't say that I understand what's going
on. The problem seems to be minimized when I set the errcutoff value
to a lower value, e.g. 0.5.

I'm also bothered by the fact that there are negative coefficients of
the fock matrices. What if I take the absolute value of every element
in the matrix A used in the least-squares fit? Will that force each of
the coefficients to be positive?

Nope, this makes the convergence much worse.

Tried some other tricks from gvbdiis: (i) the factor of 4 before the
elements of A, (ii) changing the -1 to 1. No difference.

2002-10-31
Started a new module, Ints.py, to contain many of the functions from
hartree_fock.py like getbasis and getints that had nothing special to
do with hartree_fock calculations. After I moved the routines I spent
a long time rerunning the test suite to insure that I fixed everything
I broke. It could be that Util might be a better name than Ints, but
most of the functions here are integral related.

Started a new module, Quest.py, to contain a Quest-like LDA, which
should construct the Hamiltonian in linear time.

Started new modules MNDO.py and AM1.py to contain an implementation of
Dewar's MNDO and AM1 techniques.

2002-11-09
Working on MINDO3.py. Comparing results to Mopac7 for 90deg
water. Currently I have working the core hamiltonian, and it looks
like the diagonal part of the iterative hamiltonian. The energies
match before the first diagonalize -- but the density matrix is
diagonal here, and I'm not testing the offdiag parts. 

2002-11-11
Getting most of the functions in MINDO3 to work. H atom works, for
both the E and the Hf terms. h2o gives a similar energy (-481 instead
of -476) and I assume the difference is because I'm using a different
overlap term. Not sure how to adjust the heats of formation to make
this all work out.

Removed MNDO.py and AM1.py -- I think that MINDO is something of a
Pauling point for semiempirical methods, and I don't much like the
coulomb corrections that the nddo methods use.

H atom works, B atom works, O atom works. 

I'm still getting the bonding wrong for h2o. This may be due to the
overlap term. I should either renew my efforts to reproduce the slater
term, or I should get a different scaling function.

2002-11-12
Working on the Slater overlap. Got routines bfn and ss working, now
need to figure out how to build the overlap from ss.

Decided to throw out all of that stuff, and base my approach on a
Gaussian expansion of the Slater functions (Stewart, JCP 52, 431
(1970)). This is the work referenced in setupg/gover functions of
Mopac, although I rewrote the function from scratch. These functions
are now in Slater.py. These functions are what Mopac uses when it
needs to take derivatives of the functions, which I'll need to do
eventually.

For h2o, I get:
    Eel = -476.932 024 eV
    Hf = -49.143 422 kcal/mol
Mopac gives:
    Eel = -476.932 77 eV
    Hf = -48.828 49 kcal/mol

For oh I get:
    Eel = -387.323837971
    Hf = 17.8148594438
Mopac gives:
    Eel = -387.326 16 eV
    Hf = 18.08088 kcal/mol

I think this is close enough for now. I'm going to start looking into
computing the forces now.

The differences are most likely due to either a later correction that
Mopac makes, or due to a truncation error. In either case, the
difference is small, and I'm not going to worry about 0.2 or 0.3
kcal/mol.

(Later) Fixed a bug which corrected most of the above
discrepancies. There was an ev2kcal constant that was 23.06 rather
than 23.061, and that small difference accounted for the difference
with Mopac.

2002-11-13
Did some housecleaning of the code. Tried to pull all of the parameter
specific stuff into the initialize routine. Also introduced the Atom
and the Bunch modules. Atom is a generic container for atoms, Bunch is
a generic container for anything that doesn't fit into other
containers; I'm using it here for Basis functions.

2002-11-14
Put the h2o and oh test programs into the test suite.

2002-11-17
Added some routines to simplify the program:
Minimizers.py has a simple SteepestDescent program
Bunch.py is a generic container object
Atom.py is an object to hold atom objects

2002-11-18
Added CIS.py, which currently is a naive implementation of CI-singles
(scaling as N^5-N^6), but which ultimately will be replaced with the
Foresman, Head-Gordon, and Pople approach, which scales as only
O(N^4).

Doing some basic testing. For H2 I get Ecis = 
[-0.55917495 -0.24685179  0.98250093  1.90966663  2.18051587  2.56957927
       3.32261163  4.04053978  4.21071413]
using the N^5 integral transformation, and Ecis = 
[ 0.43022164  1.08983795  1.29963302  2.17256997  2.17256997  2.22880735
       2.6624887   2.6624887   3.61130629]
The latter one makes much more sense (negative excitation energy?).

Jaguar gives:
-1.088 h for the closed-shell energy
-0.885 h for the triplet state
-0.914 h for the open-shell singlet (ihamtyp=2)

Gamess gives:
-1.088 h for the cshf energy and the CI ground state
-0.653 h for the CI excited state
+0.017 h for the second excited state
+0.197 h for the third excited state

PyQuante gives:
-1.088 for the closed shell energy
-1.088 + 0.430 = -0.658 for the first excited state?! Is this right?
-1.088 + 1.089 = 0.001 for the second excited state
-1.088 + 1.300 = 0.212 h for the third excited state

Looks like I'm in the right ballpark, at least with the
TransformIntsSlo routines. Something still wrong in the other.

Compare the CI vectors between the two cases
Here are the GAMESS vectors:
 STATE #    1  ENERGY =      -1.089903570
        1    1.000000  2000000000
 STATE #    2  ENERGY =      -0.653007343
       10    0.999530  1100000000
 STATE #    3  ENERGY =       0.017092451
        8    0.130220  1001000000
        9    0.990101  1010000000
 STATE #    4  ENERGY =       0.196583576
        8    0.989855  1001000000
        9   -0.127297  1010000000

Looks like I'm not getting the vectors correct, and that I'm just
getting out the diagonal values of the CI matrix, which are pretty
close to the correct values. Any stabilization that comes from mixing
these states would be lost. Thus, I get state 2 nearly correct, since
it's a pure state, but make bigger mistakes in states 3 and 4, that
have a small amount of mixing.

Also working on the force optimization. Here are the forces that mopac
calculates on warped ch4 in dcart/analyt:
     1     6    52.426099    52.426099     0.000000
     2     1  -179.708874    22.335532     0.000000
     3     1    22.335532  -179.708874     0.000000
     4     1    52.473621    52.473621  -127.945763
     5     1    52.473621    52.473621   127.945763
Here are the numeric forces that I compute:
(52.387421701496351, 52.38742167421151, -9.0949470177292824e-09)
(-179.71367318750708, 22.323410257740761, 9.0949470177292824e-09)
(22.323410262288235, -179.71367318750708, 0.0)
(52.501420955195499, 52.501420946100552, -127.92967916539055)
(52.501420946100552, 52.501420955195499, 127.92967915629561)

So we're at least on the same page. Now I just have to figure out
exactly what goes into these terms and reverse engineer it.

2002-11-20
In the process of reverse engineering the forces. There are three
terms to the force components: The nuclear repulsion, the
one-electron, and the two-electron. Mopac calls these TERMNC, TERMAB
and TERMAA. I get the nuclear repulsion term correct, the one-electron
term a little bit off, and the two-electron term completely off.

It's actually worse than that: Most of the individual elements that go
into termaa and termab are completely wrong. In particular, it looks
like cgbf.doverlap isn't computing the proper derivatives.

Got everything working, but I had to use ders's overlap derivatives
rather than my own. Would be nice to figure out the difference.
In any case, here's what I get:
[  5.39620039e+01   5.39620039e+01   2.84217094e-14]
[ -1.79877268e+02   2.22525122e+01   5.68434189e-14]
[  2.22525122e+01  -1.79877268e+02   6.57252031e-14]

[  51.83137589   51.83137589  127.58431674]
which is more or less correct.

Also created new modules Constants.py (which holds various conversion
units and other constants) and Elements.py (which holds data related
to elements, such as mass, atomic numbers, etc.).

Need to rederive and speed up the mopac_doverlap routine, since it
takes most of the time. I think the problem with my routine is that I
took the derivative of a basis function and then took the overlap of
it, rather than directly taking the derivative of the overlap.

Tried to speed this up by pulling the big if loop out of the inner
part of the loop over primitives, but it didn't change the timing at
all.

2002-11-25
Getting close to figuring out the source of the errors in the doverlap
calculation. Wrote a test suite that would compare the mindo to the
cgbf doverlaps for rotating h2:

ang  ------mindo3------   --------cgbf------
 0   0.60   0.00   0.00    0.63  -0.00  -0.00
10  -0.50  -0.32   0.00   -0.53  -0.34  -0.00
20   0.24   0.54   0.00    0.26   0.58  -0.00
30   0.09  -0.59   0.00    0.10  -0.62  -0.00
45   0.31   0.51   0.00    0.33   0.54  -0.00
55   0.14  -0.58   0.00    0.15  -0.61  -0.00
90  -0.27   0.53   0.00   -0.28   0.56  -0.00

so I'm only off by 5% or so. Here's what c2 looks like:
 0   0.61   0.00   0.00    0.64  -0.00  -0.00
10  -0.51  -0.33   0.00   -0.54  -0.35  -0.00
20   0.25   0.55   0.00    0.26   0.59  -0.00
30   0.09  -0.60   0.00    0.10  -0.64  -0.00
45   0.32   0.52   0.00    0.34   0.55  -0.00

90  -0.27   0.54   0.00   -0.29   0.58  -0.00

Here are the forces on distorted ch4 with MINDO3 routines:
[  5.39620039e+01   5.39620039e+01   1.42108547e-13]

[  51.83137589   51.83137589  127.58431674]

and here are the forces using cgbf doverlap:

[  3.66922888e+01   3.66922888e+01   1.42108547e-14]
[ -1.67536058e+02   2.27383823e+01  -7.46069873e-14]

[  54.05269363   54.05269363  112.85913699]

and here are the forces using doverlap_num, a numerical
differentiation.
[  3.66923701e+01   3.66923701e+01   1.42108547e-14]
[ -1.67536119e+02   2.27383800e+01  -7.63833441e-14]

[  54.05268432   54.05268432  112.85919323]

so for some reason I'm off by more here.

Distorting further by giving the C2 molecule some z character:

 0  0.6043  0.0000  0.0604   0.6396 -0.0000  0.0640
10 -0.5071 -0.3288  0.0604  -0.5367 -0.3480  0.0640
20  0.2466  0.5517  0.0604   0.2610  0.5839  0.0640
30  0.0932 -0.5971  0.0604   0.0987 -0.6319  0.0640
45  0.3175  0.5142  0.0604   0.3360  0.5442  0.0640
55  0.1415 -0.5876  0.0604   0.1497 -0.6218  0.0640
90 -0.2708  0.5403  0.0604  -0.2866  0.5718  0.0640

Here's a bit more detailed example, again of C2:
ang -------mindo-------  ------cgbf---------   -----cgbf_num-------
 0  0.604  0.000  0.060   0.640 -0.000  0.064  -0.640  0.000 -0.064
10 -0.507 -0.329  0.060  -0.537 -0.348  0.064   0.537  0.348 -0.064
20  0.247  0.552  0.060   0.261  0.584  0.064  -0.261 -0.584 -0.064
30  0.093 -0.597  0.060   0.099 -0.632  0.064  -0.099  0.632 -0.064
45  0.317  0.514  0.060   0.336  0.544  0.064  -0.336 -0.544 -0.064
55  0.141 -0.588  0.060   0.150 -0.622  0.064  -0.150  0.622 -0.064
90 -0.271  0.540  0.060  -0.287  0.572  0.064   0.287 -0.572 -0.064

where the last triad represents numerical differentiation of the
overlap. Whatever mistake I'm making in doverlap, I also am making in
doverlap_num.

The questions I have:
1. If doverlap is wrong, why does it agree with doverlap_num so
exactly?
2. If mopac_doverlap is wrong, why does it agree with the MOPAC
results so well.
3. If neither is wrong, why don't they agree with each other?
Clearly I'm missing something here.

Here's the Cpx-Cpx overlaps:
 0  0.630  0.000  0.063   0.667 -0.000  0.067   0.667 -0.000  0.067
10 -0.231 -0.835  0.028  -0.244 -0.884  0.029  -0.244 -0.884  0.029
20 -0.151  0.813 -0.037  -0.160  0.860 -0.039  -0.160  0.860 -0.039
30 -0.083 -0.711 -0.054  -0.088 -0.752 -0.057  -0.088 -0.752 -0.057
45 -0.125  0.869 -0.024  -0.133  0.920 -0.025  -0.133  0.920 -0.025
55 -0.118 -0.735 -0.050  -0.125 -0.778 -0.053  -0.125 -0.778 -0.053
90  0.147  0.833 -0.033   0.156  0.881 -0.035   0.156  0.881 -0.035

Ah found it. All of the values were off by 1.058, which equals
2*0.52918. I had put in an additional factor of 2 to make the numbers
closer. The bohr radius is converting from h/bohr to h/A.

Here are the forces now on distorted CH4:
[  5.39620039e+01   5.39620039e+01  -4.26325641e-14]
[ -1.79877268e+02   2.22525122e+01   5.86197757e-14]

[  51.8313759    51.8313759   127.58431672]

This speeds up the force calculations. Previously the profiling for
rdx forces gave:

I'm going to work from the analytic forces and try and speed up
things. Working on ch4 for a while, since it's faster:

Here's the sped up version. I inlined the call to cints.overlap so I
didn't have to do any deepcopies:

Summarizing new features for an upcoming 1.0.5 release. Here are the
new features:
* Added a MINDO3.py module, which performs semi-empirical calculations
  using Dewar's MINDO/3 Hamiltonian
* Added a Dynamics.py module to run molecular dynamics. Currently
  only the MINDO3.py module supplies forces.
* Added a Minimizers.py module with a steepest descent minimizer
  currently resides. 

Additionally, there are several subjects that have begun and are not
finished:
* Convergence acceleration
* Configuration Interaction Singles
* Quest linear scaling

Confirmed that PyQuante-1.0.5 works on Linux. Going to distribute now.
Confirmed that the PyQuante-1.0.5 downloaded from the website runs the
test suite.

UGH! I'm inconsistent with where I'm putting the IO readers. I have
both included these in IO.py, and I also put XYZ.py in there. I should
remove XYZ.py and standardize on the version in IO.py.

Playing with CIS whlie I have a few minutes to kill

Gamess gives:
-1.088 h for the cshf energy and the CI ground state
-0.653 h for the CI excited state
+0.017 h for the second excited state
+0.197 h for the third excited state

PyQuante gives:
-1.088 h for the closed shell energy
-0.645 h for the first excited state
+0.017 h for the second excited state
+0.197 h for the third excited state

These are computed using the slow integral transformation routine.
The reason I'm doing so well is these energies come without any
mixing:

0 0 (0, 1) 0.999704611586
1 1 (0, 2) 0.99996719908
2 2 (0, 3) 0.999651572511

Gamess has:
 STATE #    1  ENERGY =      -1.089903570
        1    1.000000  2000000000
 STATE #    2  ENERGY =      -0.653007343
       10    0.999530  1100000000
 STATE #    3  ENERGY =       0.017092451
        8    0.130220  1001000000
        9    0.990101  1010000000
 STATE #    4  ENERGY =       0.196583576
        8    0.989855  1001000000
        9   -0.127297  1010000000
so I'm missing out on the mixing.

...and it's understandable why, since my CI matrix is essentially
diagonal.


2003-04-07 Haven't really worked on the code in a while. Having
children does that, I guess. Trying to work on convergence
acceleration first.

0.5    -76.0118	  15
0.25   -76.0117	  20

DIIS:  -76.0118, 12 iterations (DIIS started at #4)
What is worrysome is that several of the intermediate cases had lower
energies than this: #7 had -76.057 and #8 had -76.021

Jaguar claims that the correct energy is -76.0117 (which they get
after only 8 iterations, although their first iteration is -75.755, so
their guess is a lot better).

The energies that are lower than the correct one all come from
iterations where there were negative coefficients. 

Default DIIS case:
1 -68.3247857593
2 -71.2574774349
3 -73.6750387034
4 -74.6774894422

10 -76.0114862219
11 -76.0117545604
12 -76.0117547638

Zeroing out negative coefficients:
1 -68.3247857593
2 -71.2574774349
3 -73.6750387034
4 -74.6774894422

7 -79.6853982252
8 -86.0566942848
9 -106.045188842

Clearly a bad idea...I think because it changed the overall magnitude
of the sum of the elements. 

Idea 2: zero the negative elements and renormalize:
1 -68.3247857593
2 -71.2574774349
3 -73.6750387034
4 -74.6774894422

18 -76.0117621301
19 -76.0117579592

Not a good solution...

Guess I'm going to stick with the default option.

I felt that DIIS was working well enough to put it into all of the
software. Here are the results for the test suite:

Here are my results:

3 (0, 3) -0.999652064826
9 (0, 9) -0.010300095731

Looks like this works somewhat, although I'd imagine that my orbitals
are different from what GAMESS uses.

Got the O(N^5) integral transformation working as well.

Getting ready to release v1.1.0. Released but not announced.

2003-04-09
Renamed CIS.py -> CI.py, just in case I want to code up other CI
methods. The TransformInts routine is still here, although one could
make a good argument that it should be somewhere else, such as
Ints.py.

2003-04-11
Started  QMC.py, to hold info for fixed-node QMC calculations.
Started MP.py, for MP perturbation theory calculations.

MP2 works for H2, and should work for all closed shell systems. Not
going to worry about open shell systems just yet.

Running MP2 for CH4. The integral transform is incredibly slow. I'll
have to figure out a way to speed this up sometime.  Probably should
just rewrite in C, although it also isn't too hard to make the inner
loop into a dot-product.

I should also think about breaking Emp2 into electron pair contributions.

Had to kill the CH4 MP2 run since it was too slow.

H2 integral transforms:
No dot products: 10.2 sec.
1 dot prod: 7.344 sec, same energy
3 dot prods: 3.35 sec, same energy
4 dot prods: 1.74 sec, same energy
Looks like I got a factor of 10 for free.

Could probably get a bit more by putting in a matrix multiply for two
of the indices.

It took 420.8 sec for the integral transform for ch4. But I get the
MP2 energy wrong -- by quite a bit, it turns out! 

3.5^x = 420.8/1.74 = 241.8
x = log(241.8)/log(3.5) = 4.4 So the timing is alright.

MP2 Results
Job	JagSCF	JagMP2	PyQSCF	PyQMP2	GMSMP2
H2	-1.0883	-0.0276	-1.0883	-0.0271	
He	-2.8552	-0.0255	-2.8552	-0.0254
LiH	-7.9813	-0.0204	-7.9813	-0.0209	-0.0203
CH4	-40.202	-0.1612	-40.202	-0.1682	-0.1629

So I make a mistake for everything other than h2. Ugh.

Substituted the slow integrals, but got the same result. So the
mistake probably isn't in the integrals.

Ah, fixed the bug. In MP2, to range over the unoccupied orbitals I was
looping over range(nclosed,nvirt), rather than
range(nclosed,nclosed+nvirt). Fixed.

2003-04-12
Reworked the integral transform routine for MP2 so that it only
computes the ones I need, rather than the full transform. This speeds
things up substantially.

Job     PyQMP2		told	tnew
H2      -0.0271		1.347	0.0882

LiH     -0.0209		38.3	1.74
CH4     -0.1682		380	34.4

Very cool.


2004-01-06
Working on accelerating the HGP integrals.  The code is in
PyQuante/Tests/integrals.py.

Here are the times for the H2O/6-31G** ints running on a 867 MHz PB G4 laptop:

CHGP Ints:     160.359099984
CRys Ints:    10.8592420816
CINTS Ints:    26.781692028

Much too slow right now; I had planned to compare the timing to the
pure python routines, work on improving the code there, and then
implement the changes in the C vesions, but the CHGP code is too slow
for this. 

Down shift to H2O/STO-3G on the same machine:
CHGP Ints:     2.42264199257
CRys Ints:    0.400830984116
CINTS Ints:    1.19664001465
HGP Ints:      68.4531810284
Rys Ints:   27.1079589128
Py Ints:   47.6266140938
I've got to be able to speed this up if I'm slower than the slow way
of doing the integrals.


2004-01-07
Strategy is to evolve the hgp routine into a more intelligent form. I
had initially hoped to write an hgp2 routine from scratch, but I was
intimidated by getting the code working.

Currently working from the test routine inside of hgp. Computing the
(px,px|px,px) integral from the water case.

Original hgp integral (time,value): 
1.22837793827 0.880158468466

Modifying to include contr_vrr routine:
1.24885296822 0.880158468466


Here's the profiling:

Clearly the bulk of the time is spent in vrr calls. What if I simply
use the exising contr_vrr routine to precompute all of the required
values?

The simple way of doing this didn't work, since I call contr_hrr
recursively, which means that I'm computing all of the terms each
recursive call. I'm going to modify contr_hrr to remove the recursive
stuff. 

Modifying contr_hrr:
1.50819897652 0.880158468466

(sigh^2)

The full h2o/sto-3g integral tests with this code now take:
HGP Ints:      97.1718000174

So, after a day of clever coding, I've managed to slow the code down
by 50%. My aim in this was to reduce the number of calls to vrr, by
insuring that contr_vrr was only called once for each appropriate
value. For some reason, this didn't work, and I actually *increased*
the number of calls to vrr by 20% or so.

Go back to the recursive version of contr_hrr, and see if replacing
the recursive vrr with an iterative one helps.


2004-01-20

I've been working on a more clever way of doing the VRR integrals in
hgp. 

Debugging for different input values:

Also fails in exactly the same way for the py,py and pz,pz cases,
which is strange, since if it was a simple typo it probably would only
exist for one of them.

2004-01-21
Reworked one of these cases, and I'm now off in a different way:

Looks pretty good!

Seems to be almost a factor of 2 faster.

Overall a factor of 5!

Timing of the overall code for h2o/sto-3g integrals:
(old results)
CHGP Ints:     2.42264199257
CRys Ints:    0.400830984116
CINTS Ints:    1.19664001465
HGP Ints:      68.4531810284
Rys Ints:   27.1079589128
Py Ints:   47.6266140938

(new)
HGP Ints:      30.2865087986

So I've spead up the python integrals so that they're comparable with
the Rys quadrature.


Working on putting the code into chgp.c.

Step 1. Putting in the contr_vrr routine. (mostly for convenience)
 Testsuite works. Total time = 507.5 sec
 Cf. compare to the total time with crys = 160.2

Step 2. The code is starting to work. I was a little wasteful in
implementing scratch space for the integrals. Worry about this later.

Currently the code works for everything except for h2o/hf, h2o/dft,
ne. Looks like the d-orbitals are messing it up.

The timing was slow as well (400 sec).

However, when I try to test out the d-integrals (see
Tests/integrals.py), everything looks like it's alright. At least the
c version matches the python version.



2004-01-22
Ran the h2o/hf test case. I get the correct result with HGP (after
fixing a bug), but it takes 1627 sec.

The CHGP version did *not* give the right answer, and it took 467 sec.

Running a few specific test cases. 
All two-e ints for OH/sto-3g (oriented in all directions) match
All two-e ints for O/6-31G** match except for a few of them; I'm
trying to figure out which ones now.

Looks like (2,4,9,14) is one, which is (px,pz,x2,xz). However,
(9,14,2,4) is done correctly.


Found the bug -- I hadn't set MAXAM high enough, and my assert
statements were being skipped because the distutils compile by default
with the -DNDEBUG flag in place.

h2o now works, but takes 516.5 sec, which is about as slow as it was
before the improvement.

Allocating one gigantic array for the vrr_terms and removing the
malloc/free calls speeds the code to only 48.6 sec!

This is still not as fast as the rys routine (which takes 32.4 sec),
but is at least competitive.

The total time for the test suite is now 125 sec, which is actually a
bit faster than the Rys timing (145.6), for reasons that I don't
understand. But this is enough for me to commit to the HGP algorithm
for all upcoming integrals.

2004-01-23
Here's the profiling for one of the integrals:
      324    0.280    0.001    0.530    0.002 <stdin>:462(vrr)
     1296    0.110    0.000    0.130    0.000 pyints.py:115(_gser)
     1296    0.040    0.000    0.240    0.000 pyints.py:78(Fgamma)
     1296    0.040    0.000    0.170    0.000 pyints.py:104(gammp)
     1296    0.030    0.000    0.200    0.000 pyints.py:99(gamm_inc)
Looks like I might do well to speed up the Fgamma calculations.

Using the MD recursion relationship:
    Fgterms = [0]*(mtot+1)
    Fgterms[mtot] = Fgamma(mtot,T)
    for im in range(mtot-1,-1,-1):
        Fgterms[im]=(2.*T*Fgterms[im+1]+exp(-T))/(2.*im+1)
Seems to speed things up quite a bit, at least in pure python.

Whoops, I may have been timing the crys all along.

TessSweet times:
chgp	  128.3
crys	  92.4	Guess that's still a bit faster

h2o/sto-3g test
hgp/old	  31.802
hgp/new	  23.062
chgp/old  1.127
chgp/new  0.916

Total TessSweet with chgp/new: 108.1; not quite as fast, but perhaps
fast enough to use it over crys. I really don't know why it isn't
faster than Rys.


How many times are vrr called with recursive hrr?
324 (for the simple test case)
The iterative one:
729 (Hmm. Something must be wrong).


2004-01-27
Doing some tests with the calling order:
crys: ijkl	 89.023
      klij	 88.544
chgp: ijkl	 106.14
      klij	 105.98
      ijkl/sw	 106.63
Guess there was no hanging fruit to be gotten from rearranging the
call order.

2004-02-01
There may be some more low-hanging fruit with interchanging the x,y,z
coordinates so as to minimize the recursion in hrr and vrr.

Still no big difference. I don't know why putting the large values in
the y-direction wins, I would have thought it would either be the
x-dir or the z-dir. Perhaps there are two opposite effect, one of
which favors the x, and one which favors the z, so that when you add
them together, neither wins.

I'm not sure there really is any low-hanging fruit. Here are all of
the integral calls for h2o. 

Whoops! Can't print them all out. But it's clear that there is a
wide-enough range of integrals that a routine to put integrals in the
fastest form would be worthwhile.

Here are the rules for such a routine:
1. Large values should be in the a or c position of (ab|cd) rather
than the b or d positions, which are almost twice as slow.
2. There may be some minor advantage to having large values in
x-direction rather than y- or z-directions, but this may be too small
to make a difference.
3. There may be some advantage to having large values in the ab
position of (ab|cd) rather than cd, but this also may be too small.

Unaltered routine for h2o test:
-76.0117511531 -76.011751 48.0270109177

AB/CD swaps:
40.36 seconds! Nice improvement.

Total timings for the test suite:
        No swaps  AB/CD swaps
crys    95.97     101.24
chgp	116.6	  114.44

Hmm. There is another wrinkle that I didn't think of, since evidently
the swaps don't help as much as I would have thought they would have.

Guess I still have to stick with crys/noswaps.

Attempting to do a grid-based integration for the DFT J operator.
The routine is in dft.getJ_dft, and basically uses the nuclear
attraction integrals. I can rewrite this routine to pass in the entire
vector of grid points so that I only need a single call; such a
routine would also speed the nuclear attraction integrals, although
this is a negligible amount of time.

I had to put in an arbitrary factor of -0.5, but now the two J
matrices are within 1% or so, which is probably about right. The J_dft
is still much slower, but I know how to speed this up.

I got an answer of -75.7552 (rather than -75.8769). I think if I can
pull out the reference density the way Quest does this will work
better, since it will be less dependent on the grid density.

Tried to run this in the Quest module, and I should have had exactly
the same results as before, but instead I got a convergence that
looked like:

I'm going to retest the h2o_dft.py module before doing further hacking
of Quest.py. Here's what h2o_dft puts out:

  -75.7552  -122.3457    46.4834    -8.7339     8.8410
Here is Quest.py, with the terms regrouped to match what h2o_dft.py:

Whooo! It will probably be faster if I renormalize the sum of dens0
over the atomic grid to the atomic number.

  -75.7551  -122.3472    46.4851    -8.7341     8.8411
Turns out that the grids were surprisingly un-normalized:

Atno  Initial  Renorm
8     18.286   8
1     8.396    1
1     8.650    1

Can't imagine why the TF densities are so far off. This was with the
Sommer's rho. The Tietz rho is even worse:

8     21.068   8
1     10.013   1
1     10.244   1

Okay, fixed that bug; don't know where it came from. Here are the
current integrated densities:

8 5.63148221941    8.0
1 0.645113649623   1.0
1 0.658004445484   1.0

The smaller values probably comes from the fact that I'm truncating
my grid at too small a value.

Here are the new convergence behavior, first not renormalized, then
renormalized.

-----------------2004-03-31-----------------
I've written the cints routine that groups all of the nuclear centers
to a single call; this code is running fairly slowly, I think because
it's swapping. But it appears to have the right values.

-----------------2004-04-01-----------------
Here are the timings for one iteration using the nuclear and
nuclear_vec routines.

nuclear:
  -75.1270   -71.8019    -4.1032    -8.0631     8.8411

Well, a little bit faster. 

I put in a function that excludes points with charge < 1e-8:
  -75.1270   -71.8022    -4.1029    -8.0631     8.8411
296.440u 10.220s 7:17.90 70.0%  0+0k 0+10io 0pf+0w

The right way to do this is to compute the distance of the grid point
to the gaussian center, and then exclude all points with
abs(w*q/r)<1e-10.
  -75.1270   -71.8019    -4.1032    -8.0631     8.8411
342.660u 13.940s 7:55.40 75.0%  0+0k 0+5io 0pf+0w

1e-8:
  -75.1270   -71.8019    -4.1032    -8.0631     8.8411
351.700u 11.860s 7:10.08 84.5%  0+0k 1+9io 0pf+0w
Huh? Don't understand. Maybe the overhead with computing the distance
is simply too high. It's easy to speed up using a blocked grid, or
using the atom distances. Also, this is a pretty small molecule, and
there probably isn't enough distance to justify doing too much work
on each call.

1e-6:
  -75.1271   -71.8025    -4.1026    -8.0631     8.8411
344.340u 11.930s 7:03.60 84.1%  0+0k 0+11io 0pf+0w
Wow. I don't get it. 

Try just using w*q now: 1e-8:
  -75.1270   -71.8019    -4.1032    -8.0631     8.8411
322.710u 12.220s 10:30.47 53.1% 0+0k 2+8io 0pf+0w

Seems like abs(q)>1e-8 is the best way to do this.

Here's the problem: nuclear vec is called inside the PGBF unpacking
routines. Which means that I'm still looping over all of the PGBF
functions before calling it, hence the many, many calls.

Before I code up that routine, I've rewritten the PGBF version
slightly, unpacking the grid only once, and passing in separate
arrays for xc, yc, zc, wc, and qc. I'm going to see how much this
speeds things up, it should be a nice speed bump, I think. I should
have been tipped off by the fact that in the profiling, nuclear_vec
amounted to 181 sec total time, whereas getJ_dft_vec amounts to 333
sec. I believe that it is this difference that I've removed now.

------------------2004-10-19------------------
Relicensed the entire code under the modified BSD license.

------------------2005-03-11-------------------
Removed get_nel() and get_enuke() from the hartree_fock module, and
made these instance methods of Molecule.

------------------2005-07-07--------------------
Moved the installation of cints, crys, and chgp into the PyQuante
directory. These routines now need to be called as PyQuante.cints, etc.

------------------2005-09-13--------------------
MAJOR: made 'charge' a property of Molecule (default=0).
Tried to make this change in a reasonably reliable manner
by putting a deprecation warning in Molecule.get_nel(charge).

Removed 'charge' from scf argument list in hartree_fock.py and dft.py

-----------------2005-10-13----------------------
Added Travis Oliphant's optimize.py package.

Cleaned up the EXX.py module in preparation for adding it.

Rearranged some of the entries in hartree_fock.py and dft.py. The
major change is that optional arguments are now largely passed 
through an **opts dictionary, which makes it much easier to 
pass these in. But this may break some existing code.

Wrote a C version of the three_center_1D function, which is much 
faster.

----------------2005-10-24------------------------
Started to work on a spin-averaged, open-shell DFT. 

Replaced mkdens with mkdens_spinavg in dft.py. This allows dft
calculations when nopen != 0. This should also be fairly easy to
extend if I want to do a fermi-dirac occupation, which will now
be a trivial extension.

Need two test cases: (1) h2o, to make sure it's still the same, and 
(2) no_dft, to see whether it works.

MAJOR: Fixed a bug in the grid construction. When the spingrid
routines were called in AtomicGrid they were modifying the Lebedev
data structure, which means that the angular grids were slightly
different each time the shells were constructed. This manifested
itself in different energies for the h2o_dft case, depending upon
whether it was run as part of the test suite, where it gave -75.8769,
or alone, where it gave -75.8572. Both versions now give
-75.857635. Whew!

----------------2005-10-25------------------------
Created Molecule.get_closedopen() and Molecule.get_alphabeta()
functions. 

Modified the uhf module to use **opts options and to use the 
Molecule.get_alphabeta() function.

Added no_uhf to the test suite. 

Tagged everything with Release_1_4, in preparation for new point
release. 

*** Released v1.4.0. ***

Modified test suite to keep track of test failures.

Changed basis -> basis_data for imports from basis set data files.
There were too many variables that could have been named 'basis'
in the program, and I think this clarifies things.

Also removed all extraneous uses of basis imports (since getbasis
now uses 6-31G** as the default).

----------------2005-10-26------------------------
Created Molecule.add_basis() and Molecule.add_grid(). Both
use much nicer, **kwarg based inputs. Neither is used right
now, but the plan is to eventually use these as the default
constructors for grids and basis sets. Neither function returns
anything, but rather defines Molecule.basis and Molecule.grid.

---------------2005-10-28------------------------
Made some changes to the AtomicGrids module, and now the Pople
style SG1 grids are much closer to working. The AtomicGrids module
is also much nicer now.

---------------2005-11-04------------------------
Programmed up the Becke projection operator for patching grids
together. This has dramatically increased the accuracy of the
calculations. Here's a comparison of the old way of patching grids to
the new way, for H2 at different radii.

R/A      E_old/h          E_becke/h

0.775 -1.12775123871    -1.13568116218

1.000 -1.10636018922    -1.11414655987  

This is so dramatically better that I plan to release a new version of
the code with this feature activated much sooner than I normally
would. Still need to code up the hack Becke uses for patching atoms of
different types, but as soon as that's done I'll release a new version
of PyQuante. 

Coded up the heteroatom corrections. Here are results for LiH:
R      No hetero      Heteroatom corrections
0.65  -7.47130290273  -7.46902627618
0.70  -7.54989675061  -7.54866165454

1.00  -7.79469184381  -7.81223566871

I'm also going to set this by default. Although note that Pople
doesn't use these corrections. I'm mainly choosing these because they
"look" more smooth, but this is by no means a real comparison.

Also expanded the test suite to allow do_hf, do_dft, do_only_hf, etc,
flags to be passed in as keyword arguments.

---------------2005-11-08------------------------
Tested removing the spingrid corrections. They don't really do much
now that we have the Becke projection weights in there, and no one
else uses them.

Here's the H2 dissociation test:
       Spin      Nospin
0.650 -1.12534  -1.12527
0.700 -1.13277  -1.13271
0.750 -1.13560  -1.13555
0.800 -1.13505  -1.13502
0.850 -1.13205  -1.13203
0.900 -1.12725  -1.12726
0.950 -1.12115  -1.12120
1.000 -1.11415  -1.11423

Here's the LiH dissociation
       Spin      NoSpin
0.650 -7.46903  -7.47103
0.700 -7.54866  -7.55069
0.750 -7.61488  -7.61693
0.800 -7.67006  -7.67208
0.850 -7.71604  -7.71798
0.900 -7.75430  -7.75612
0.950 -7.78603  -7.78773
1.000 -7.81224  -7.81381

I'm going to take out the spingrid option, since I'm going to be
modifying the grid stuff a lot as I code up the Becke Poisson solver,
and I want the code to be as simple as possible. I would normally just
change the options, but in this case I want to make the constructors
easier. The spingrids routines are still in AtomicGrid.py if anyone
wants to use them.

Also updated the benchmark energies in the dft test cases. 

In a similar type of cleaning, I removed the setdens0 and dens0 type
functions and variables. This will break the Quest module, but that
was essentially broken anyway. I'm keeping the Quest module around for
historical reasons, but I should probably remove it.

Does pruning the points really speed up the code? The dft test suite
took 109.47 sec. Commenting out the pruning the suite takes 106.49
sec. I'm going to remove all of the pruning code to simplify the grid
code. 

Decided that the patch_atoms_becke worked well enough that I just
killed the old-fashioned patching scheme.

---------------2005-11-14------------------------
Wrote some test cases for the spin-averaged open-shell DFT.
Appears to work well.


---------------2005-11-14------------------------
Working on Fermi-Dirac occupations of DFT.

Removed the fdscf and fdhf routines (actually, just commented out).
Moved fdhf.py to fermi_dirac.py.

Testing closed shell system: h2_ft_dft.py.
Setting occs to:
 [1.0,0.0]       -1.1327  (correct energy)
 [0.99,0.01]     Diverges positive
 [0.999,0.001]   Diverges positive

Fixed a bug. Changed:
        d = c[i,:]
to
        d = c[i:i+1,:]
in mkdens_occs. The former is a vector, the latter is a matrix.
Setting occs to:
 [1.0,0.0]       -1.1327  (correct energy)
 [0.999,0.001]   -1.1318
 [0.99,0.01]     -1.1233
 [0.9,0.1]	-1.0376

Now testing with Temps:
  T=1      -1.1327
  100	   -1.1327
  10000	   -1.1323
  100000   -0.6467

Test open shell system (Li)
  T=0      -7.3321
  T=1      -7.3332 (conv probs)
  T=1e2    -7.3332 (conv probs)
  T=1e4    -7.3084
  T=1e5    -7.0211
Conv problems go away when I tighten the tolerance in get_efermi.

Removed Vec3 stuff.

Added li_ft_dft and h2_ft_dft to the Test Suite.

---------------2005-11-21------------------------
Working on Fermi-Dirac occupations of HF.
Seems to be working. See h2_ft_hf.py test case.


---------------2005-12-05------------------------
Started working on density gradients and GGA functionals.

Fixed a bug in PGBF.grad().

Looks like density gradients now work.

---------------2005-12-06------------------------
Reworked the interface to rhf and dft, which, among other things,
involved removing the scf and dft_scf modules.

Added the EXX.py module to the repository. Reworked the interface so
that one no longer needs to instantiate a class to run the code.

Added test_exx.py module to the tests directory.

--------------2005-12-07-------------------------
Started looking at writing GGA functionals, but it's harder than 
I had initially thought.

The code to compute the gradients is now put into the grid point at
construction, so I don't have to keep passing in the option.

I put together xfuncs and cfuncs, two dictionaries that return the
appropriate DFT X or C function given a string. These can return
'None' for the correlation function, in, say, S0.

------------2005-12-08---------------------------
Got spin-polarized versions of the S and VWN functionals
working. These functions are now called by default.

------------2005-12-12---------------------------
Got BLYP working over the weekend. Still have to look at some of the
higher-order terms to see how I need to change things.

------------2005-12-16---------------------------
Getting PBE working. Currently only have the first order terms
working for PBE and BLYP, but the energies seem to be pretty good thus
far. 

Currently trying to get a "readable" PBE working. 

Added an option where guess orbitals can be passed into rhf or dft.
Added an option where the code returns en,orbe,orbs from hf/dft
routines. Made sure that all of the test suite worked with this.

Updated the EN2 routine to use the UHF routines and to use calling
conventions consistent with the rest of the code.

------------2005-12-17---------------------------
Added hartree_fock.hf, which is an interface to both rhf and uhf.
Ultimately this will check spin_type to alternately call rohf for open
shell systems.

------------2005-12-18---------------------------
Got a 'readable' PBE correlation functional together. Verified that it
reproduces the correct results.

Started work on the ROHF routines

------------2005-12-19---------------------------
Renamed EXX.py to OEP.py, since it's a more appropriate name.

------------2005-12-25---------------------------
Molecules can now be constructed using atomic symbols instead
of atomic numbers in their constructor lists, e.g.

    h2o = Molecule('h2o',
                   [('O',(0.,0.,0.)),('H',(1.,0.,0.)),('H',(0.,1.,0.))],
                   units='Angstrom')

-----------2006-03-15----------------------------
Playing around with numpy-0.9.6 instead of Numeric.

Here's the test suite on Powerbook using Numeric: 347.1 - 363.1 sec
(range of multiple runs).

Wrote a wrapper routine that can import either from numpy or Numeric
based upon the value of use_numpy. This lets me use the switch to
modify the actions of the entire program.

I may have developed an error in H2/FT/DFT and Li/FT/DFT. Oh, I think
this is due to the inclusion of the entropy term.

Wow! Using numpy is a lot slower, at 615 sec!! Guess I'll stay with
Numeric for now.

While I'm mucking around, I'm going to switch back to Numeric, and
then run the entire test suite through a profiler.

Okay, found the mistake. Array elements in numpy are special types,
and scalar operations on these new types can be much slower. The big
killer were the grid routines in DFunctionals, and by replacing
dens[i] with float(dens[i]), forcing conversion to a standard python
float object, the time went from 615 sec to 297 sec, which is even
faster than the old routines. One nice thing about numpy is that the
new setup routines correctly identify the math libraries, which were a
pain to properly compile using Numeric 23.1.

On sahp5351, the test suite took 81.8 sec using Numeric, and 74.5 sec
using numpy. Nice little speedup.

-----------2006-04-05----------------------------
Switched over optimize to use either numpy or Numeric via NumWrap.
This involved some minor changes to NumWrap.

Experimented with my own version of BFGS, which doesn't seem
to work as well as Travis's.

----------2006-04-06------------------------------
Included a simple Logger module. Replaced all output during runtime
to go into a file via this module. Is properly flushed, etc.

----------2006-09-01-------------------------------
Compiled and ran the code on a Macintel Mac Mini. Test suite ran in 99 sec. 
My mac laptop runs in 272 sec.
